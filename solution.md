# Welcome to Project Purple Cow!

## Description:

This is a simple counting application that fetches a number of "hits" from CountAPI and reveals it to the user whenever a button is pressed.

## Deployment:

This application can be locally deployed using Docker, by navigating to the root /purple-cow directory and typing the command `docker compose up`. This will run the app from its Docker image at localhost:3000. 

If you need to change the port locally, you can modify the frontend port in the docker-compose.yml file to "{your port here}:3000".
